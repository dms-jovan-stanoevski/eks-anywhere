helm install -n portainer portainer portainer/portainer \
--set tls.force=true \
--set service.type=LoadBalancer

Once done and the portainer pod is up and running

kubectl edit deployment portainer -n portainer

Under the Containers section

Edit the volumeMounts to look like this. Ensure that the YAML formatting and indentation exactly looks like the below, else it will error

        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: data
        - mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs/tls.pem
          name: crt
          subPath: tls.pem

Edit the volumes to look like this. Ensure that the YAML formatting and indentation exactly looks like the below, else it will error

      volumes:
      - name: data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: portainer
      - configMap:
          defaultMode: 420
          name: castore
        name: crt

Ideally the kubernetes control plane will restart the deployment. 
However, just to ensure no further errors occur, delete the pod manually so that the fresh pods inherit the newer template values
